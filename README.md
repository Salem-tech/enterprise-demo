Overview

This project demonstrates a collection of enterprise-grade features and workflows, implemented using a variety of modern tools, frameworks, and best practices. While all sensitive content has been stripped, the structure reflects real-world solutions developed in professional environments.

The goal is to showcase versatility in full-stack development, integration of AI tools, automation, and system design within secure, modular, and maintainable codebases.

Tech Stack & Tools

The demo involves a combination of the following technologies (depending on the project module):

Frontend: React, Vue, or plain JavaScript (with modern ES features)

Backend: Node.js (Express), .NET Core, or Python (FastAPI)

Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Microsoft SQL Server

APIs: RESTful & GraphQL

AI Tools:

Integration with OpenAI API, Microsoft Azure AI Services, or Hugging Face Transformers

Use of LangChain, RAG pipelines, or prompt engineering for LLM-based modules


DevOps & Automation: Docker, GitHub Actions, basic CI/CD pipelines

Version Control: Git (hosted on GitHub)

Others: SharePoint integrations, Power Automate flows, data visualization with Chart.js / D3


Purpose

To illustrate adaptable problem-solving using real patterns and scalable design.

To experiment with incorporating AI-driven components into existing systems.

To serve as a practical sample of enterprise-grade code for personal portfolio presentation.
